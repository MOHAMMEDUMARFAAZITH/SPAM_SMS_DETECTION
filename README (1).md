In world online consumption of products and services are increses, consumers are facing a huge problem of spam messages in their inboxes which are either promotional-based or fraudulent. But due to this the messages/Email which is of much importance are squashed under the spam messages.

In this project, we are going to create an SMS spam detection model which will help you to find whether an SMS is a spam or not using Naive Bayes and Natural Language Processing(NLP).
